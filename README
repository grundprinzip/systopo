systopo by Martin Grund <grundprinzip@gmail.com>

`systopo` is a very simple parser written in C++ that allows to parse the content of `/sys/devices/system/cpu` and automatically creates a small hierarchy of dependent objects. The goal of `systopo` is to automatically retrieve information about the NUMA nodes, number of cores and the cache hierarchy of the system.

To build `systopo` download the archive and executed `make`. This will build the library and a small test binary. 

NOTE: The program will only run on recent Linux systems with a 2.6.* kernel and probably only Intel processors.
